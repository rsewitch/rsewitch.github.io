           <p>Here are a few of my Writing Works that I have written as a Journalism student in my previous classes at UF. Enjoy! </p>




            

<h2> NEW AND IMPROVED BUS SYSTEM AT THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA </h2>

<p>At the University of Florida other ways of transportation are recommended such as a scooter, a bike, or more importantly UFs improved bus system, known as the Regional Transit System.</p>

<p>The Regional Transit System has been in partnership with UF since 1992.  The Office of Sustainability created the One Less Car Campaign in 2008 to ideally become carbon neutral by 2025.  </p>
 
<p>Carbon neutral is a term used to describe fuels that neither contribute to nor reduce the amount of carbon in the air.  By making use of the bus system offered, the carbon footprint is significantly reduced. </p>

<p>The marketing and communications supervisor for the RTS, Chip Skinner, says students should take advantage of the bus system because students are paying for it.  Students have unlimited access to the bus system with tuition costs.
</p>
<p> “Take advantage of the system,” says Skinner</p>
 
<p>Each bus is equipped with a GPS system that allows students to track the buses and click on the bus stop to list all routes and times the bus will be arriving. </p> 

<p>“I always know the exact time I have to leave my house to go to the bus stop because I have the GPS system, Transloc on my phone. I can see exactly where the bus is so I know if I have to rush out of my house or not,” said Brooke Wildison, a UF junior.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Andria Thomas, a junior at UF, primarily uses her bike for transportation. </p>

<p>“If I’m to tired to ride my bike home which is quite often, I take the bus. All the buses have a bike rack on them which is convenient,” said Thomas.</p>

<p>Other than being convenient, the bus system of 116 busses is also a cheaper transportation alternative. According to the American Public Transportation Association, having a car costs the average person 9,200 dollars per year. </p>

<p>Each bus can hold up to 72 people, which takes 72 vehicles off of UFs campus, ultimately decreasing the carbon footprint. This is the primary goal of the Sustainability Program at UF. The transit system caters to all UF students and faculty.</p>

<p>“From Oct. 1st 2011 to Sep. 30th 2012, there has been 10 million bus rides,” says Skinner.

 <h3> BlEED ORANGE AND BLUE </h3>

<p>In a perfect world, there is no trash talk between the opposing football teams. In fact, Gator fans tailgate with opposing team alumni and fans, passing the ketchup and playing each other in Cornhole, reminiscing about previous team meet ups.  There is no bitterness, false accusations or bad feelings between the two.  Win or lose, Gator fans embrace an LSU fan, South Carolina fan, or Florida State fan with open arms and warmth in their hearts.  And pigs can fly…</p>

<p>Welcome to the Swamp where Gators “bleed orange and blue.” A respectable football team winning three national championships, University of  Florida football games attract 85,000 fans to each home game. Home games take place at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.  The crowd sways and chants the “Orange & Blue Fight Song” or “Mr. 2Bits,” a few of the traditional songs that make game day so special and dear to Gators’ hearts.  </p>

<p>Gainesville is the type of city where store owners close down for the day and put signs on their doors saying “Gone to the game”. However, there is more to game day than just watching the football game, there’s tailgating. </p>
    
<p>It is no secret that an excessive amount of binge drinking takes place on game day, those drinking their sorrows if the Gators lose, or celebrating a win by shot gunning a beer with a buddy.   Gator victory or not, everywhere you go in Gainesville it’s a party, whether you’re on Fraternity Row, a buddy’s house on 13th St. or at O!O on University Avenue.</p>

<p>“I don’t let any non-Gator fans into the bar on game days,” jokes Nicholas Riley, a five-year bouncer at O!O Bar and Grill. “I broke up six fights last home game when we played LSU and had to carry 15 kids out the bar for being too drunk. I have my work cut out for me on game day, I’ll tell you that much,” says Riley.</p>

<p>With that said, it’s safe to say tensions between rival teams run deep, only heightened with the use of alcohol.  However, they’re safe ways to tailgate. Michele Emery, a doctor at the Shands Hospital stresses the importance of staying hydrated and eating a good meal.</p>

<p>“Hold you and your friend accountable. Think ahead of time. Have a limit on how many drinks you both can have and make sure you guys stick to it,” says Emery.</p>

<p>According to Ben. R. Tobias, the Department Spokesperson for the Gainesville Police Department, GPD reported 33 arrests for the LSU game. Ninety Seven officers were assigned for the game. Tobias stresses the importance of people’s safety on game days.</p>

<p>“Be responsible.  We want everyone to have a fun game day experience, but just realize your limits and don’t go past them,” says Tobias.</p>

<p>“When the Gators played LSU a couple weeks ago, I saw two people get tasered by a police officer and a guy passed out in a bush outside of Chipotle on University Avenue,” said Andria Thomas, a UF junior. </p>

<p>Whether you’re a Gator fan or not, all can come to a consensus that being tasered is definitely not on the top of “How to have a fun game day” list.
