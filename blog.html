<p> Being a New Yorker, you know we LOVE to speak our mind. With that said, I created a blog, called "Can You Dance to My Beat", that talks about relevant news and/or issues within the Electronic Music scene. I am very passoniate about Electronic music, so much so that it's not even a hobby of mine, but more of a lifestyle. NYC was my stomping ground and through my blog, I share my expirences and thoughts regarding the buzz of EDM. Also, seeing as I am a UF Gator now, I also keep it local- talking about upcoming shows and writing reviews. Check it out.
