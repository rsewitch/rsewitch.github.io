            <p>Hello and welcome. My name is Rebecca Sewitch and am a current Senior at the University of Florida.  I transferred to UF in the fall of 2012 from the University of Tampa and boy- am I glad to be a Gator!  I was born July, 26th 1992 in Manhattan, New York and currently live in Westchester County, just outside NYC. Most think its comical seeing a city girl in the country, but I’m certainly not opposed to four-wheeling and duck hunting!  Moving to Gainesville, Florida was definitely a culture shock, but you can hear me playing a few country tunes from time to time and hitting up the bar, 8 Seconds to go line dancing (attempting to line dance).

            <p> The biggest culture shock of all was people's taste in music. Up North, I rarely hear country and down here it is the most popular music played.  Through this website and my Blog, I want to share my passion for the Electronic Music Scene and hopefully get all of you on the bandwagon. My dream is to get back to the city and pursue a career in music promotions and writing reviews for DJ's and Clubs. Being a city girl, I know the ins and outs of the club scene- something I miss everyday. Through this website and my Blog, I want to share my passion for the Electronic Music Scene and hopefully get all of you on the bandwagon, or at least raise some interest in the music. </p>

<p>My major is Telecommunications, something that I thoroughly enjoy.  I love travelling and meeting new people.  I was never really a math and science type of girl. I’d rather be writing or out in the field interacting with people.  I live every day like its my last and always try to look on the bright side in every situation.  Life is to short to complain. You can check out my Blog, a few of my writing works, my Resume and my Guide to Ultra Music Festival, a annual music festival in Miami.  Enjoy. </p>
