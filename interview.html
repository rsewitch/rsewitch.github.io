     <h1> Drew White knows whats'up! </h1>





 <p>I decided to interview a buddy of mine, Drew White on his overall expierence at Ultra in 2011. He's a great guy and has been bumping Electronic music and Djing for years now. </p>

 

  <h3> What was your favorite part about Ultra? </h3>

  <p> My favorite part about Ultra hands down was the Carl Cox Pavilion. When I went in there I heard things I'd never heard before and it was fundamentally different from the dance music I was used to hearing. You haven't lived until you've seen Carl Cox spin live. The man takes you to a different planet.  </p>


 <h3> When you went to Miami, where did you stay? </h3>

  <p>I stayed at the RIU Miami Beach hotel. It was right on the water on 31st & Collins and it was very suitable for people visiting Miami for UMF. Great environment, great accommodations, awesome hotel.  </p>


 <h3> Did you go to any after parties?  </h3>

<p>When I went to Ultra I was only 19 years old so I wasn't able to attend any after parties but the night before it started I went to the Pretty Lights Music label showcase at the Fillmore down in Miami Beach which was a blast. My remaining time there was spent at Bicentennial Park for UMF.  </p>


<h3> What was the ultimate feel at the festival?</h3>
 
 <p>The overall feel of the festival was a bit childish and some of the attendees seemed a bit out of place and/or lost but my overall feel was great because of the new sounds I had discovered.  </p>


<h3> How was the venue? <h3>
 <p>I enjoyed the venue very much, it was spacious and spread out and evenly dispersed with people. The only thing I would've suggested that year would have been some attention to two particular stages that were too close together that had a small sound bleeding problem. Other than that, the venue was awesome and I liked it's setup very much.  </p>

<h3> How much do you think you spent? </h3>
 
 <p>I hate to say it, but in the 6 days I was in Miami I spent a little bit over 1,200 dollars and that did not include my flight, hotel, or festival ticket. Miami, is quite an expensive place to enjoy yourself in.  </p>


<h3> Were you there just for the festival, or WMC, MMW and after parties?   </h3>

<p>I was only in Miami for the festival, but I did attend another event the night before UMF started.  </p>


<h3> Who were your favorite DJS? </h3>

<p> My favorite DJs of the weekend were Carl Cox, Wolfgang Gartner, Loco Dice, Erick Morillo, Conspirator, Fedde Le Grand, and Moby.            </p>
        

 <h3>Any suggestions to new comers attending festivals? </h3>

<p>I wouldn't suggest anything to any newcomers. Any festival is what you make it, so don't over-prepare, don't try and over-plan, just go in with an open mind and let the rest fall into place.  </p>
