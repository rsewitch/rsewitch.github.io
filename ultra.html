    <p>Ultra Music Festival is the Super Bowl, Stanley Cup and Kentucky Derby of all raves. Ultra Music Festival is as three day Festival on March 28th-30th. As the world’s most famous outdoor electronic music festival, ULTRA has won “Best Music Event” by the International Dance Music Awards      (IDMA) six consecutive years, from 2005 to 2011, “Best International Dance Music Festival” by the Ibiza DJ Awards in 2008 and “Best Festival” by the Village Voice Media New Times consecutively five years running from 2005 through 2009.  Originally created as a pure electronic music festival in 1999, ULTRA has grown through the years to present all realms of the Electronic music scene from melodic trance, to dirty dubstep drops  and groovy tech. In 2013, as it celebrated its 15 year anniversary, ULTRA became the first major EDM festival in the world to expand to two weekends: March 15, 16 and 17 and March 22, 23 and 24. Both weekends sold out with a combined total of over 330,000 people in attendance from 95 countries, breaking the festival’s previous record. </p>

    <p> Ultra Music Festival not only takes place in Miami, but is now global, travelling to Korea, Chile, Ibiza, Argentina and Crotia.  </p>

    <p>The 16th edition of Ultra Music Festival will take place from March 28th – 30th 2014, with a second weekend pending approval from the City of Miami. </p>

    <p> Becuase of the festivals rising popularity and staggering numbers of atendess I've decided to create a comprehensive guide to all you ravers to make your weekend(s) in Miami sucessful. Seeing as I've been attening Miami Music Week, Winter Music Conference and Ultra for the past 5 years, this is not my first rodeo. I'll tell you the essentials that you need to make the most out of your expirence, the best hotels to stay at and all the best clubs for after parties.  Of course, I had to throw in a little biography and tribute to the God himself, Carl Cox who spins for 2 days and even has his own "tent" at the festival named after him. </p>

    <p> Enjoy and take notes! </p>
