            <p>Hello and welcome. My name is Rebecca Sewitch and am a current Senior at the University of Florida.  I transferred to UF in the fall of 2012 from the University of Tampa and boy- am I glad to be a Gator!  I was born July, 26th 1992 in Manhattan, New York and currently live in Westchester County, just outside NYC. Most think its comical seeing a city girl in the country, but I’m certainly not opposed to four-wheeling and duck hunting!  Moving to Gainesville, Florida was definitely a culture shock, but you can hear me playing a few country tunes from time to time and hitting up the bar, 8 Seconds to go line dancing (attempting to line dance).</p>

<p>My major is Telecommunications, something that I thoroughly enjoy.  I love travelling and meeting new people.  I was never really a math and science type of girl. I’d rather be writing or out in the field interacting with people.  I live every day like its my last and always try to look on the bright side in every situation.  Life’s to short to complain! With said, enjoy my website! You can check out my Blog, a few of my writing works, my Resume.  Enjoy! </p>
